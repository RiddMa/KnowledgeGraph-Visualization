\def\abstractzh{
近年来，互联网信息安全漏洞造成的风险不断增加。由于漏洞信息的收集与发布工作分散在互联网各处，且通常以纯文本的形式发布共享，这造成网络安全工作者及软硬件开发者，难以轻松直观地获知相关项目或资产的漏洞风险情况。而提供类似可视化漏洞知识图谱服务的多为商业公司、其系统不公开且收费高昂。

基于此背景，本项目设计并实现了使用 GPL-3.0 自由软件许可证授权开源的“基于漏洞知识图谱的可视化系统”。

本文第二章进行数据采集、知识图谱、持久化、可视化等功能的技术调研与理论基础介绍，分析并确定了开发本系统采用的技术栈。第三章针对系统数据流、功能和非功能需求进行了需求分析，细化系统开发目标。第四章进行了系统概要设计、系统功能模块设计、系统详细设计：针对系统数据流分析，设计系统总体及分层结构，将系统划分为五个子系统，形成项目框架；随后划分功能模块、针对每个功能模块明确其功能与职责，并为模块绘制了类图与功能时序图。第五章以流程图形式阐述各个子系统的设计与实现，并以文字与伪代码形式阐述关键功能模块的设计与实现。第六章对系统运行速度与运行结果进行简单测试，以截图形式展示可视化系统的实现效果。第七章总结了本项目所做的工作，并展望未来系统的发展方向。

% ABSTRACT
\def\abstracten{
In recent years, the risks caused by Internet information security vulnerabilities have been increasing. Since the collection and distribution of vulnerability information is scattered all over the Internet and usually shared in the form of plain text, it is difficult for network security researchers and hardware and software developers to easily visualize the vulnerability risk of related items or assets. Most of the companies that provide similar vulnerability knowledge graph visualization services are commercial companies, whose systems are not public and charge high fees.

Based on this background, this project designs and implements a ``Vulnerability Knowledge Graph-based Visualization System'' open-sourced under the GPL-3.0 Free Software License.

Chapter 2 of this paper introduces the technical research and theoretical foundation of data collection, knowledge graph, persistence, visualization and other aspects of the system, and analyzes and determines the technology stack used to develop this system. Chapter 3 conducts requirements analysis for system data flow, functional and non-functional requirements, and refines the system development objectives. Chapter 4 presents the system outline design, system functional module design, and system detailed design: for the system data flow analysis, the overall and hierarchical structure of the system is designed, and the system is divided into five subsystems to form the project framework. Then the functional modules are divided, their functions and responsibilities are clarified for each functional module, and class diagrams and functional timing diagrams are drawn for the modules. Chapter 5 illustrates the design and implementation of each subsystem in the form of flowcharts, and the design and implementation of key functional modules in the form of text and pseudo-code. Chapter 6 conducts a simple test on the running speed and results of the system, and demonstrates the visualization system in the form of screenshots. Chapter 7 summarizes the work done in this project and looks forward to the future development of the system.
